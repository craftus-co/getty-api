## Getting Started

> The service saves the Bearer token in `SESSION`,
> all services are server-side. 
> Database is a MUST!!!

## ‚è±Ô∏è Crons

`2 cronjobs` as following

1. every `30min` 
	1. runs count query (checking all new images)
	2. saves into db the new images with `filename` and `meta`
2. every `35min`
	1. runs the query to send to cloudinary donwloadable `URLS` from getty (url expires after some time)
	2. after upload successfull, update `downloaded: TRUE` into db, so service will know that image was uploaded
	3. finally running query to bulk edit `filename` & `meta` on all the iamges that was just uploaded
